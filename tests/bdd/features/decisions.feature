Feature: Decision Making Process
  As a manager or decision maker
  I want to systematically evaluate and make decisions on submitted ideas
  So that valuable ideas are implemented efficiently

  Background:
    Given the decision service is running
    And there are ideas available for decision making
    And decision criteria are configured

  Scenario: Manager creates implementation decision for high-scoring idea
    Given I am a manager with decision-making authority
    And there is an idea with ID "idea001" that has:
      | metric | value |
      | upvotes | 45 |
      | average_rating | 4.7 |
      | engagement_score | 0.85 |
      | days_since_published | 14 |
    When I create an implementation decision for the idea
    And I provide rationale "Strong employee support and clear business value"
    And I set implementation timeline to 60 days
    And I assign it to development team "team-alpha"
    Then the decision should be created successfully
    And the idea status should change to "approved"
    And implementation plan should be attached
    And stakeholders should be notified

  Scenario: Automated decision suggestion based on criteria
    Given there are configured decision criteria:
      | criteria | threshold |
      | min_vote_count | 20 |
      | min_average_rating | 4.0 |
      | min_engagement_score | 0.7 |
      | min_days_since_created | 7 |
    And there is an idea that meets all criteria
    When the automated decision engine runs
    Then a decision suggestion should be generated
    And the suggestion type should be "implementation"
    And confidence score should be provided
    And human review should be flagged if confidence is low

  Scenario: Committee-based decision making for high-impact ideas
    Given there is a high-impact idea requiring committee review
    And decision committee consists of:
      | member | role | expertise |
      | mgr001 | Product Manager | Product Strategy |
      | mgr002 | Engineering Manager | Technical Feasibility |
      | mgr003 | Finance Manager | Cost Analysis |
    When the idea is submitted to committee
    Then each member should receive notification
    And voting interface should be available to committee
    When all members cast their votes
    Then committee decision should be calculated
    And consensus level should be determined
    And final decision should be recorded with all member inputs

  Scenario: Decision escalation for controversial ideas
    Given there is a controversial idea with mixed signals:
      | metric | value |
      | upvotes | 30 |
      | downvotes | 25 |
      | controversy_score | 0.8 |
      | expert_endorsements | 3 |
      | business_alignment | high |
    When initial decision review occurs
    Then the idea should be flagged for escalation
    And senior leadership should be notified
    And additional analysis should be requested
    And extended review period should be set

  Scenario: Decision template usage for consistent decision making
    Given there are predefined decision templates:
      | template | type | use_case |
      | quick_win | implementation | Low-effort, high-impact ideas |
      | research_project | modification | Ideas requiring investigation |
      | cost_benefit | implementation | Ideas with significant costs |
    And there is an idea suitable for "quick_win" template
    When I select the quick_win template
    Then decision form should be pre-populated
    And standard rationale should be suggested
    And typical timeline should be set
    And resource requirements should be estimated

  Scenario: Decision impact tracking and measurement
    Given there is an implemented decision from 6 months ago
    And implementation metrics are available:
      | metric | value |
      | implementation_time | 45 days |
      | cost_actual | $15000 |
      | cost_estimated | $12000 |
      | benefits_realized | $25000 |
      | employee_satisfaction | 4.2 |
    When I review decision outcomes
    Then decision success score should be calculated
    And lessons learned should be documented
    And template improvements should be suggested
    And future decision criteria should be updated

  Scenario: Rejection decision with detailed feedback
    Given there is an idea that doesn't meet implementation criteria
    And business constraints include:
      | constraint | impact |
      | budget_limit | High cost exceeds Q1 budget |
      | resource_availability | Development team fully allocated |
      | strategic_alignment | Not aligned with 2024 priorities |
    When I create a rejection decision
    And I provide detailed feedback on each constraint
    And I suggest alternative approaches
    Then the rejection should be recorded with full rationale
    And the idea owner should receive constructive feedback
    And the idea should be tagged for future reconsideration

  Scenario: Decision audit trail and governance
    Given there are multiple decisions made over time
    When compliance officer requests decision audit
    Then complete decision history should be available
    And all decision events should be timestamped
    And decision makers should be identified
    And rationale should be accessible for each decision
    And bias analysis should be possible

  Scenario: Batch decision processing for efficiency
    Given there are 25 ideas awaiting decisions
    And 15 ideas meet auto-approval criteria
    And 10 ideas require manual review
    When I run batch decision processing
    Then eligible ideas should be auto-approved
    And manual review queue should be populated
    And decision makers should be notified of pending reviews
    And processing summary should be generated

  Scenario: Decision criteria optimization based on outcomes
    Given there is historical decision data from 100+ decisions
    And outcome metrics are available for implemented ideas
    When ML-powered criteria optimization runs
    Then success patterns should be identified
    And criteria thresholds should be suggested for updates
    And false positive/negative rates should be calculated
    And recommendation confidence should be provided

  Scenario: Cross-functional decision coordination
    Given there is an idea affecting multiple departments:
      | department | impact | stakeholder |
      | Engineering | High | CTO |
      | Marketing | Medium | CMO |
      | Sales | Low | VP Sales |
      | Legal | Medium | Legal Counsel |
    When decision coordination is initiated
    Then all stakeholders should be included
    And impact assessment should be requested from each
    And coordination timeline should be established
    And final decision should require all approvals

  Scenario Outline: Decision validation and business rules
    Given I am a decision maker
    When I try to create a decision with "<decision_type>" and status "<status>" for idea with score "<score>"
    Then the decision should <result>
    And I should receive message "<message>"

    Examples:
      | decision_type | status | score | result | message |
      | implementation | approved | 0.9 | succeed | Decision created successfully |
      | implementation | approved | 0.3 | fail | Score too low for implementation |
      | rejection | rejected | 0.9 | warn | High-scoring idea being rejected - confirmation required |
      | | approved | 0.8 | fail | Decision type is required |
      | implementation | | 0.8 | fail | Decision status is required |

  Scenario: Decision reversal and change management
    Given there is an approved decision that needs reversal
    And implementation has not yet started
    When authorized manager requests decision reversal
    And provides valid business justification
    Then original decision should be marked as reversed
    And new decision should be created with reversal rationale
    And all affected parties should be notified
    And audit trail should capture the change
