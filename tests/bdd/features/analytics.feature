Feature: Analytics and Machine Learning
  As a business analyst and data scientist
  I want to analyze idea patterns and generate insights
  So that I can optimize the innovation process and predict successful ideas

  Background:
    Given the analytics service is running
    And Spark cluster is available
    And there is historical data with 1000+ ideas
    And ML models are trained and available

  Scenario: Idea clustering analysis for pattern recognition
    Given there are ideas across different categories and themes
    When I run the idea clustering analysis
    Then ideas should be grouped into meaningful clusters
    And cluster themes should be automatically identified
    And similar ideas should be grouped together
    And cluster characteristics should be documented:
      | cluster_id | theme | idea_count | avg_engagement |
      | 1 | AI/Automation | 45 | 0.78 |
      | 2 | Sustainability | 38 | 0.82 |
      | 3 | Employee Experience | 52 | 0.71 |
      | 4 | Cost Optimization | 29 | 0.65 |
    And clustering quality metrics should meet thresholds

  Scenario: Topic modeling for emerging trends identification
    Given there are idea descriptions and comments from the last 6 months
    When I perform topic modeling analysis
    Then emerging topics should be identified
    And topic evolution over time should be tracked
    And trending topics should be highlighted:

      | idea789 | 0.85 | High | Strong engagement, clear value prop |
      | idea790 | 0.42 | Medium | Moderate interest, implementation risk |
      | idea791 | 0.23 | High | Low engagement, unclear benefits |
    And high-potential ideas should be flagged for priority review

  Scenario: Employee engagement analytics dashboard
    Given there is employee interaction data from multiple touchpoints

      | Average Session Time | 8.5 min | +3% |
    And engagement patterns by department should be analyzed
    And top contributors should be identified
    And engagement improvement recommendations should be provided

  Scenario: Real-time streaming analytics for live insights
    Given the streaming analytics pipeline is processing live events
    When ideas are being voted on and commented on in real-time
    Then live engagement metrics should be updated continuously
    And trending ideas should be identified within minutes
    And anomaly detection should flag unusual patterns:
      | anomaly_type | description | severity |
      | Vote Surge | Unusual voting spike on idea123 | Medium |
      | Comment Flood | High comment volume in 10 minutes | Low |
      | User Behavior | Same user voting on 50+ ideas rapidly | High |
    And alerts should be sent to moderators for high-severity anomalies

  Scenario: Business impact measurement and ROI analysis
    Given there are implemented ideas with tracked outcomes
    When I analyze business impact over the last year
    Then ROI metrics should be calculated:
      | metric | value |
      | Ideas Implemented | 23 |
      | Total Investment | $450,000 |
      | Measured Benefits | $1,200,000 |
      | ROI Percentage | 167% |
      | Average Implementation Time | 45 days |
      | Success Rate | 78% |
    And cost-benefit analysis should be detailed by category
    And high-impact ideas should be studied for success patterns

  Scenario: Predictive analytics for resource planning
    Given historical implementation data and current pipeline
    When I run predictive resource planning analysis
    Then future resource needs should be forecasted
    And implementation timeline predictions should be provided
    And capacity constraints should be identified:
      | month | predicted_implementations | required_resources | capacity_gap |
      | Jan 2024 | 8 | 12 developers | 4 developers |
      | Feb 2024 | 6 | 9 developers | 1 developer |
